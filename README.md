# Connect 4
Just a tiny project to make a connect 4 game in C playable in a Bash terminal and an AI to play with.
To get more used to pointers I'll attempt to not store the state of the board as a global variable, also adding the perk of allowing a board of costumizable size that will be stored in a 2D array, and allowing me to learn to work witdynamic memory allocation.
